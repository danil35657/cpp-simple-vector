# cpp-simple-vector

## Description

A simple vector is an analog of std::vector, provides sequential storage of elements in dynamic memory, fast random access to an element by index, dynamic change in the size of allocated memory, etc.

## Instructions for use

Upload the archive with the project to the local directory of your computer. You must have a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.) or an IDE with C++ support.  We recommend using the latest versions of compilers or IDE. 

To compile a project and create an executable file (using the GCC compiler as an example), run on the command line:
```
g++ *.cpp â€“o vector
```
Next, run the executable file "vector" on the command line.

An example of using a simple vector (adding and removing elements, accessing elements, etc.) is contained in the "main" file. If necessary, delete the lines with examples or comment out.

## System requirements

1. GCC version at least 11.2.0 (or another C++ compiler).

2. The C++17 standard.

## Plans for completion

Refine the vector functionality to all the features of std::vector

## Technology stack

1. GCC 11.2.0

2. C++17 (STL)
